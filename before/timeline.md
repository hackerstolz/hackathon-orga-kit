|  |  |  |  |  |
| T-12W | T-3W | Find a Location |  |
|  |  |  | Clarifiy availability during the event (all night? opening hours?) | It is preferable to have the location open all night long, but this requires to consider the subsequent items |
|  |  |  | Security or night watch required? | Clarify whehter the location owner requires this (especially over night -> see subsequent item) |
|  |  |  | Decide: overnight availability -> Security or team members? | If not external security is available -> at least two Hackerstolz members must be onsite all the time -> plan night shifts early!! |
